Although much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests, in a world of evolutionary architecture it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members and for external oversight.

Although these items are often stored in a wiki or collaboration tool, we generally prefer storing them in source control with simple markup.
