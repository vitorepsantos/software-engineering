#Three Laws of TDD.

1. You must write a failing test before you write any production code.
2. You must not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile.
3. You must not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.

The Red/Green/Refactor cycle.
